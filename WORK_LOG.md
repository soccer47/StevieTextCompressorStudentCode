| Dec 1 | 4:20pm-4:55pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I looked at the problem set and decided to try to write out every word as its own number. I thought that using a hashmap would be helpful for keeping track of the numbers associated with each word. In my first draft of my compression method I take in all of the words and write them into a hashmap file, however now that I think about it I'm not sure if this is allowed as it requires additional information to be stored in the hashmap file. |
| Dec 1 | 5:40pm-6:10pm | I went for a walk to try to come up with more ways to approach the problem set. I came to the conclusion that if the final solution has a less than 50% compression ratio, then the algorithm is likely supposed to compress word by word, not letter by letter. This ratio also likely means that using a hashmap isn't allowed, because reducing each word to a number would result in a smaller ratio. I tried to come up with another way to compress the words, and the best I came up with was that I might be able to reference the 1st usage of each word in a repeated instance; for each subsequent usage of the word I would write out the start and end indexes of where it first occurred. |

I spent just over half an hour trying to code through the first draft of this method, and I think I'll also use the escape codes to switch between modes like we discussed in class. |

I am trying to make methods for more pieces of my code in order to make the main compression method easier to parse. I don't think that this method will achieve the sub 50% compression ratio, however I think it still is promising |

At this point I'm not sure how efficient my compression ratio will be, however I also just want to see if I can even get this method to work. A lot of the time I'm spending is just thinking through how each aspect of my code would function and the going off to solve that specific element, as this approach is currently pretty convoluted. I have finished my first draft of the compression method, and just started the expansion method. |
