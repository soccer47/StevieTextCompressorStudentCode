| Dec 1 | 4:20pm-4:55pm |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I looked at the problem set and decided to try to write out every word as its own number. I thought that using a hashmap would be helpful for keeping track of the numbers associated with each word. In my first draft of my compression method I take in all of the words and write them into a hashmap file, however now that I think about it I'm not sure if this is allowed as it requires additional information to be stored in the hashmap file. |
| Dec 1 | 5:40pm-6:10pm | I went for a walk to try to come up with more ways to approach the problem set. I came to the conclusion that if the final solution has a less than 50% compression ratio, then the algorithm is likely supposed to compress word by word, not letter by letter. This ratio also likely means that using a hashmap isn't allowed, because reducing each word to a number would result in a smaller ratio. I tried to come up with another way to compress the words, and the best I came up with was that I might be able to reference the 1st usage of each word in a repeated instance; for each subsequent usage of the word I would write out the start and end indexes of where it first occurred. |

I spent just over half an hour trying to code through the first draft of this method, and I think I'll also use the escape codes to switch between modes like we discussed in class. |

I am trying to make methods for more pieces of my code in order to make the main compression method easier to parse. I don't think that this method will achieve the sub 50% compression ratio, however I think it still is promising |
| Dec 3 | 1:55pm-2:25pm |                                                                                                                                                                            I have continued to code my first draft of the index-referencing method. At this point I'm not sure how efficient my compression ratio will be, however I also just want to see if I can even get this method to work. A lot of the time I'm spending is just thinking through how each aspect of my code would function and the going off to solve that specific element, as this approach is currently pretty convoluted. I have finished my first draft of the compression method, and just started the expansion method. |
| Dec 3 |  2:25pm-3pm   |                                                                                                                                               I finished my expansion method and have started running the code in the terminal to start working out the bugs. I decided to for now use 8 bit characters for every letter and not only  bits, as I thought it would add too much complexity for my first draft to differentiate between uppercase and lowercase and digits. I am currently getting an empty input stream error from my expansion method, however right before I was printing out the numerical ASCII values of the letters, so I think I'm close to getting it functioning for abra.txt. |
| Dec 3 |  7pm-7:30pm   |                                                      I continued to debug my code, and was able to figure out a few errors that were causing the empty stream error. I was thereby able to get my code to work for the abra.txt test (though the "compressed" file was actually slightly expanded). However, for the larger test cases (like alice.txt) I wasn't able to get my expansion file, specifically the part that decodes the codes for the words, to work. I am now getting index out of bounds errors when I try to call substring on the text String, meaning that my reading in of the integers representing the index and/or length of the first instances of the words is likely faulty. |

I understood the concept behind this approach well enough when it was presented in the class, and I've spent the last half hour working on my first draft of the compression method for this approach. |
| Dec 5 |  9pm-9:30pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I eventually finished my first attempt at the compression method for the LZW approach, and have started working on the expansion method. However, I started trying to write the parts where the TST of codes is involved, and I'm having a bit of trouble figuring out how to relate the codes back to words. |
